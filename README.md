## 3D pathfinding algorithm visualization tool

My goal with the project was to teach myself WebGL based graphics and related technologies.
As a result, the application has an editable 3D environment, which permits the user to build his own obstacle course for pathfinding algorithms in a 3-dimensional space.
The editor permits moving the start and endpoints, adding/removing walls (obstacles), and resizing the 3D space available for the algorithm.
The app is desktop- and mobile-optimized (Chrome browser recommended in both cases), and you can access it here:
